Autonomous Robot Car with Obstacle Avoidance and Waypoint Navigation
Welcome to the repository for my Autonomous Robot Car project! This robot is designed to navigate to a goal point while avoiding both static and dynamic obstacles. It can also follow a set of waypoints using the Nav2 navigation stack in ROS 2. This project is perfect for anyone interested in robotics, autonomous navigation, and ROS 2.

Features
Autonomous Navigation: The robot can autonomously navigate to a specified goal point.

Obstacle Avoidance: It can detect and avoid both static and dynamic obstacles using sensors and algorithms.

Waypoint Following: The robot can follow a predefined set of waypoints.

Nav2 Integration: Utilizes the Nav2 package for robust navigation and path planning.

Customizable: Easily extendable for additional features or integration with other ROS 2 packages.

Prerequisites
Before using this project, ensure you have the following installed:

ROS 2 (Humble or Foxy recommended)

Nav2 package (navigation2)

Gazebo or another simulation environment (optional but recommended for testing)

Rviz2 for visualization

Python 3 and C++ (for custom scripts and nodes)

Installation
Clone this repository into your ROS 2 workspace:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Build the workspace:

bash
Copy
colcon build
Source the workspace:

bash
Copy
source install/setup.bash
Usage
Launch the Simulation (if using Gazebo):

bash
Copy
ros2 launch your_package_name simulation.launch.py
Start Navigation:

bash
Copy
ros2 launch your_package_name navigation.launch.py
Set Goal Points or Waypoints:

Use Rviz2 to set a goal point or load a waypoint file.

Alternatively, use a custom script to send waypoints programmatically.

Monitor Robot Behavior:

Observe the robot navigating to the goal while avoiding obstacles.

Check the terminal for logs and diagnostics.

Configuration
Sensor Configuration: Adjust sensor parameters (e.g., LiDAR, camera) in the config/ directory.

Navigation Parameters: Tune navigation behavior in the params/ directory.

Waypoint File: Add or modify waypoints in the waypoints/ directory.
