# Autonomous Robot Car with Obstacle Avoidance and Waypoint Navigation

Welcome to the repository for my Autonomous Robot Car project! This robot is designed to navigate to a goal point while avoiding both static and dynamic obstacles. It can also follow a set of waypoints using the **Nav2** navigation stack in ROS 2. This project is perfect for anyone interested in robotics, autonomous navigation, and ROS 2.

---

## Features
- **Autonomous Navigation**: The robot can autonomously navigate to a specified goal point.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: It can detect and avoid both static and dynamic obstacles using sensors and algorithms.
- **Waypoint Following**: The robot can follow a predefined set of waypoints.
- **Nav2 Integration**: Utilizes the **Nav2** package for robust navigation and path planning.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable for additional features or integration with other ROS 2 packages.

---

## Prerequisites
Before using this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **ROS 2 (Humble recommended)**
- **Nav2** package (`navigation2`)
- **Gazebo (classic)** or another simulation environment (optional but recommended for testing)
- **Rviz2** for visualization
- **Python 3** and **C++** (for custom scripts and nodes)

---

## Installation
1. Clone this repository into your ROS 2 workspace:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HassanRamadan02/learn_one.git
   ```
2. Build the workspace:
   ```bash
   colcon build
   ```
3. Source the workspace:
   ```bash
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

---

## Usage
1. **Launch the Simulation** (if using Gazebo):
   ```bash
   ros2 launch learn_one launch_sim.launch.py
   ```
2. **Start Navigation**:
   ```bash
   ros2 launch learn_one navigation.launch.py
   ```
3. **Set Goal Points or Waypoints**:
   - Use Rviz2 to set a goal point or load a waypoint file.
   - Alternatively, use a custom script to send waypoints programmatically.

4. **Monitor Robot Behavior**:
   - Observe the robot navigating to the goal while avoiding obstacles.
   - Check the terminal for logs and diagnostics.

---

## Configuration
- **Sensor Configuration**: Adjust sensor parameters (e.g., LiDAR, camera) in the `config/` directory.
- **Navigation Parameters**: Tune navigation behavior in the `config/` directory.
